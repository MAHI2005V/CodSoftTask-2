---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my Data Science Internship with CodSoft, where I explored the fundamentals of supervised machine learning through a classic classification problem — the Iris Flower Dataset. 🌸
The aim was to develop a model that accurately classifies Iris flowers into their respective species based on four key features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build and evaluate a classification model that can categorize Iris flowers into one of the following species:

🌼 Setosa

🌷 Versicolor

🌹 Virginica

using their sepal and petal measurements as input features.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- `Python`
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- `scikit-learn` (DecisionTreeClassifier, accuracy_score, cross_val_score, etc.)

## 📊 Model Overview

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ✅ Data Cleaning | Checked for nulls and cleaned dataset |
| 📐 Feature Engineering | Extracted and selected relevant columns |
| 🔀 Data Splitting | Used `train_test_split()` with `test_size=0.25` |
| 🌳 Model Used | `DecisionTreeClassifier` |
| 📈 Evaluation | Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Cross-Validation |

---

## 📌 Results

- 🎯 **Training Accuracy**: 100%
- ✅ **Cross-Validation Accuracy**: 97.33%
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**: Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- 🌳 **Tree Visualization**: Decision Tree plotted using `plot_tree()`
