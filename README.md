## 🚀 Task 2: Iris Dataset Classification (CodSoft Internship)

This repository contains my submission for **Task 2** of the **#CodSoft Internship**, where I worked on classifying Iris flowers into different species using machine learning.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a supervised machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into one of the following species:

- *Setosa*
- *Versicolor*
- *Virginica*

based on their **sepal** and **petal** measurements.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- `Python`
- `Pandas`, `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- `scikit-learn` (DecisionTreeClassifier, accuracy_score, cross_val_score, etc.)

---

## 📊 Model Overview

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ✅ Data Cleaning | Checked for nulls and cleaned dataset |
| 📐 Feature Engineering | Extracted and selected relevant columns |
| 🔀 Data Splitting | Used `train_test_split()` with `test_size=0.25` |
| 🌳 Model Used | `DecisionTreeClassifier` |
| 📈 Evaluation | Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Cross-Validation |

---

## 📌 Results

- 🎯 **Training Accuracy**: 100%
- ✅ **Cross-Validation Accuracy**: 97.33%
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics**: Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- 🌳 **Tree Visualization**: Decision Tree plotted using `plot_tree()`
